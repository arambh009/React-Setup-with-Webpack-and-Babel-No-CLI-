npm init          //creates package.json
install react react-dom  //needed in webapp
npm i --save-dev webpack webpack-dev-server webpack-cli //installs webpack and helps to run cli command
npm i --save-dev babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-env babel-preset-react html-webpack-plugin
// babel-core is core transpiler, babel-loader to compile react's JSX,babel-preset-env to compile es6 and beyond,html-webpack-plugin generates our build html file for publishing

created webpack.config.js

created index.js in  'src' folder

created index.html in  'src' folder

create .babelrc to specify our babel presets

add scripts to package.json to run webpack dev server and one to build out our project in dist folder by replacing:-

"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"

with:-

"start":"webpack-dev-server --mode development --open --hot"
"build":"webpack --mode production"

in "scripts" of package.json

npm start
//output was not shown and error was thrown:-
ERROR in ./src/index.js
Module build failed (from ./node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js):
SyntaxError: C:\Users\aramb\.vscode\Web dev\React and webpack\src\index.js: Support for the experimental syntax 'jsx' isn't currently enabled 
// to resove(it just resolved) i did:-

npm install @babel/core @babel/preset-env 

npm i -D @babel/core @babel/preset-env


//changed babelrc from:-
{
  "presets": ["env", "react"]
}

to:-
{
   
    "presets": [
        "@babel/preset-env","@babel/preset-react"
      ]
}

//HOLA it WORKED!!!!!!!
